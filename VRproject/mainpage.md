## Overview

This project aimed to develop a PC and Virtual Reality (VR) application using C++, Qt, and VTK, allowing users to interactively view, organize, and edit CAD models of the Formula Student car.

---

## Objectives

- Build a Qt GUI to load, display, and manipulate CAD assemblies.
- Integrate VTK for 3D model rendering.
- Add VR support using OpenVR with HTC Vive Pro 2.
- Provide tree-based model management, filters, and visibility controls.

---

## Features

### Qt GUI
- TreeView for model structure
- Menus, toolbars, and context actions
- Drag-and-drop STL loading

### VTK Rendering
- Real-time CAD rendering
- Clip & Shrink filters
- Custom shaders and lighting

### VR Support
- Dedicated VR rendering thread
- Mirrored actor system
- Full 6DoF tracking and room-scale support

### Deployment
- NSIS installer with dependencies
- Auto-generated docs via Doxygen + GitHub Pages

---

## Technologies
- C++
- Qt 6.8.2, VTK 9.4.2, OpenVR
- CMake, Visual Studio 2022, GitHub, NSIS

---

## Learning Outcomes

Enhanced skills in cross-platform GUI dev, 3D rendering, VR architecture, Git workflow, and packaging.

---

## Conclusion

The final application enables effective inspection and visualization of detailed CAD models, ready for future extensions like simulation or remote collaboration.
